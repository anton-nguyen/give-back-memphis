					<p class="testimonial-text"><strong>A Fire Inside</strong><br/>
						Working as a volunteer consultant with GBM has been enjoyable, but the main reasons to do it are that it is a stimulating way to stir up your skills and experience, while making a contribution to the community which is more immediate and relevant than simply writing a check.  I have been privileged to work with some innovative new projects in need of a little foundational direction and some long-standing groups  that have neglected their organizational structure for quite a while.  All that with colleagues who were great to work with and "clients" who are receptive and appreciative.  As the old saying goes, there may be snow on the roof but there is still a fire inside.

					<p class="testimonial-text"><strong>Bright, Experienced, and Insightful</strong><br/>
						Working as a consultant for Give Back Memphis is truly a two-way street. While you make important contributions to the non-profits with which you are associated, each consultant gets a great deal back. You have the opportunity to work with bright, experienced and insightful people. The projects on which you work are not just interesting. Each has its challenges. In addition, as regards GBM itself, you get the satisfaction of working with a really innovative organization. For anyone who is retired or simply has time, this is a great place to channel your time and energy while making a meaningful contribution to the community.

						It is rare in my experience as a consultant to find an opportunity to make a real contribution to the betterment of an important nonprofit, and at the same time feel like I have paid back at least some of the debt I owe to the community that has been so good to me for so long. That is the feeling I had working through Give Back Memphis.

I felt proud to support their work.

					<p class="testimonial-text"><strong>Deeply Satisfying and Rewarding</strong><br/>
						My experience as a GBM consultant has been deeply satisfying and rewarding. Memphis nonprofits serve all segments of our community in a variety of ways. By providing expertise developed over years of business/nonprofit experience on a pro bono basis, I get the satisfaction of helping a valuable community asset while also getting the opportunity to interact with talented and dedicated leaders from whom I can learn. To continue this valuable work, GBM needs more individuals that will donate their time, talent, and treasure. I would highly recommend that you consider becoming part of the GBM team.

					<p class="testimonial-text"><strong>Doing What I Do Best</strong><br/>
						Being a professional consultant for Give Back Memphis has been a wonderful opportunity to use my professional skills and expertise after retirement. Nonprofits generally have a lean staff and don’t always have access to the resources they need. By providing pro bono accounting services, I can have a positive impact on our community by doing what I do best, which in turn, allows the organization to fully focus on their mission.

It is an unbelievable network of executives and business experts who believe that nonprofits can transform communities if given the right opportunities, resources, and leadership. For the past four years, I found the projects engaging, challenging, and most rewarding.

					<p class="mb-5">Consulting projects can range from three months to over a year.  We have found that many times the consultant establishes a deep connection with their clients and continues to make themselves available well beyond the original project timeline.  On average a consultant can expect to spend 10-20 hours each month on a project.  Twice a year consultants meet to help improve Give Back Memphis’ processes and offerings and to share experiences. We have found that consultants often establish a deep connection with their clients and continue to make themselves available.</p>
