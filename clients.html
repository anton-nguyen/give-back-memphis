						Each consultant was an expert in their area, knowledge and experience were outstanding. All the consultants went way above and beyond what was asked/needed. CAG was able to use all recommendations, tailored very specifically to our needs. With their experience and expertise they guided us in several key areas including: accounting, strategic and program planning, legal advice, nonprofit formation, and human resources.

						Beyond the strategic plan and overall direction this initiative provided…I would say that we really took the marketing analysis to heart. This started with the focus group led by Lisa and the surveys that followed. We have taken the data and survey feedback very seriously, it has led to many realizations and improvements. When we look back we realize in how many ways the plan has guided everything we’ve done this year. It’s been immensely helpful and has done an excellent job keeping us focused and on track.

						Give Back Memphis provided consultants that made a positive impact in the growth of our organization.  These consultants are true professionals in their respective fields and very experienced in the non-profit arena. With the combination of their talents, they were able to help us grow our board of directors by assisting us in developing board profiles and teaching us how to reach out to new, potential board members.  In addition, they reviewed our corporate documents and made important modifications to our bylaws and board of director’s recruitment package.  STARS is better positioned for growth and sustainability because of Give Back Memphis.

						On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Lisieux Community, I would like to thank you for providing the assistance of the consultants, Cathy Barbara and Terry.  I had felt stuck because of the things I had not been able to assimilate on my own. I learned so much about the things I needed to consider as we prepared the documentation because of the questions they asked in our discussions. It helped me put into perspective the different parts of the organization so that I can plan accordingly in the future. They spent a lot of their personal time and effort to draw out the information and arrange it in a useful way.
